    { q: "How long does a custom software development project usually take?", a: "Most custom web applications and business automation tools transition from initial discovery to live cloud deployment within 6 to 12 weeks. Large-scale setups like extensive ERP systems or multi-tenant software are scheduled in iterative phases to maintain continuous development transparency." },
    { q: "Do we retain absolute ownership over our software assets and code repositories?", a: "Yes, completely. Once milestone allocations are successfully completed, all source code assets, database frameworks, cloud deployment parameters, and architectural documentation are fully transferred over to your organization." },
    { q: "How does your team guarantee long-term web performance and system security?", a: "We apply modern web development standards at every step. This involves implementing isolated data layers, strict cross-origin token access rules, robust password hashing, and continuous dependency updates to prevent software stability issues." },
    { q: "Can you modernize or scale our existing web software without breaking it?", a: "Yes. We frequently build modern web applications and custom admin dashboards designed to sit cleanly over legacy data setups, allowing companies to improve internal tools without causing any operational downtime." },
    { q: "What types of AI solutions can you integrate into our business platforms?", a: "We build tailored AI integrations, semantic search tools, and semantic reporting modules using advanced technology like Gemini AI. These are built to process internal data streams, automate service requests, and optimize resource logistics." },
    { q: "What kind of support is available after our product launch?", a: "We offer comprehensive maintenance plans that cover regular frontend performance optimization, software security auditing, dependency upgrades, and immediate feature scaling to ensure long-term value." }
